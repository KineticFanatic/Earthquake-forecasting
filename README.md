# Earthquake-forecasting

An earthquake is an extreme shaking of the surface of the earth. The shaking is caused by vibrations in the outermost layer of Earth.
Data was initially collected for the Himalayas and adjacent regions from the 1964 to 2019.
All earthquakes in the dataset with magnitude greater than 6.0 were considered.
The obtained dataset contains 50 points in total.
Declustering is done to eliminate Aftershocks and Foreshocks events from the dataset.
The earthquake occurrence phenomena is a statistical process so we consider the interevent times are considered as random variables which are associated with some probability distribution.
This can now be used to forecast future earthquakes.
The non-parametric K–S criterion is free from any prior assumptions and it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the cumulative probability distribution of different curves
Using the best fit LogNormal model, the estimated mean interevent time for a magnitude 6.0 or higher event in the study region turns out to be approximately  1.35 +/- 2.20 years, whereas the estimated cumulative probability reaches 0.90–0.95 after about 6–8 (2022–2024) years since the last event in October 2016.
